# React Server Rendering

An example of how to serve React components on NodeJS in order to decrease the load time of the application. Created because of a post on my personal blog. Link on the repository.

## Ussage

Clone the repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MiguhRuiz/react-server-render.git
```
Install all packages(both server and client):
```bash
$ npm install
```

Build the components(the FrontEnd ones, **Gulp is required**):
```bash
$ gulp
```
Start the server
```bash
$ npm start
```
